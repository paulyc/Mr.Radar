"Now that I have my coffee, I'm ready to watch radar. Where is it?"

"Right here, sir!"

[_Spaceballs_, 1987]

## Objective
Automate the collection and distribution (in human-parsable format) of raw radar data particularly the....

### TDWR Level III Base Reflectivity Data (48nm range)
Seems NOAA likes shuffling this around to keep people on their toes* but as of 21 May 2020 it's under

ftp://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/SL.us008001/DF.of/DC.radar/DS.180z0/SI.txxx/sn.0yyy

where txxx is the station eg ttpa = Tampa and the yyy is a monotonically increasing counter but it wraps around
at some point like 250 so, sn.last is the most recent one, and one could use the size/timestamp to figure out where
in the chronological order it is. Those files are in the Offical Mr. TDWR(R) Binary Format(TM) as specced by NOAA
and you can use something like [their Weather and Climate Toolkit](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/wct/index.php) to turn it
into an image. (Much like the TDWR data itself, by the time you're reading this it may have moved, so, being in the
public domain as a Work of the Federal Government(R), I have also taken the liberty of putting it in
[a repo](https://github.com/paulyc/NOAA-WCT) that should last at least as long as this one, and at the same URI....

[*] No I have never even worked at a private company that kept their engineers' docs up to date, can only imagine the
absurd hassle it must be trying to fix any of them when they're the government's

## Why Do I Want This?
Because, at least if you live within 48 nautical miles of a major U.S. airport, the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar
there gives you a much higher resolution radar image than the more widely ranged NEXRAD system, and it is rarely
found in any OSS apps or free weather websites, if even any paid ones (at the current time of writing, I believe
even Weather Underground has not updated their radar widget to pull TDWR from the new URI so they've all been
perpetually 'down for maintenance' for as many months as I can remember checking, though, [they are not really](https://radar3pub.ncep.noaa.gov/))
