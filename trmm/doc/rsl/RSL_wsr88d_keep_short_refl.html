<h1>RSL_wsr88d_keep_short_refl</h1>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<b>#include &quot;rsl.h&quot;</b> <br>
<b>void RSL_wsr88d_keep_short_refl(void);</b>

<h3>
<hr>Description</h3>
Calling this function instructs the WSR-88D Level II ingest to keep
short-range reflectivity collected in the velocity portion of a split
cut.  Normally this short-range reflectivity is discarded.
Calling this function also changes how split cuts are handled in the
Radar structure and when writing to UF.  Split cut surveillance and
Dopper sweeps are normally placed in the same sweep index in the Radar
structure, as though they were taken in a single sweep, so that
reflectivity (long-range), radial velocity, and spectrum width are at
the same sweep index.  If <b>RSL_wsr88d_keep_short_refl</b> is called, each
individual sweep of a split cut is stored at a separate index, so for
example, the first sweep contains only long-range reflectivity (and
dual-pol fields if present), and the second sweep contains short-range
reflectivity, radial velocity, and spectrum width.  This pattern is
repeated with the remaining split cuts.  If a UF is produced, the
split cuts are written in like manner.
