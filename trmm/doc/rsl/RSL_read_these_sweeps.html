Synopsis</H3>

Description</H3>
Call this routine prior to any ingest routine and only the sweeps specified
will be stored in memory.&nbsp; This drastically reduces memory requirements
and speeds up the ingest, especially, if you're only interesed in a few
sweeps.&nbsp; This function is useful, for instance, when you're making
images of the base sweeps.&nbsp; Why bother reading the entire file when
you only need the first sweep? By default, all sweeps are ingested.&nbsp;
The sweep# is a character string representing the sweep number, "4" for
instance.&nbsp; Order does not matter.&nbsp; Specify NULL as the last argument.
This signals this routine when to stop parsing&nbsp; for sweep numbers.&nbsp;
The first sweep is "0".

<P>The list of possible sweep numbers is: "all", "none", "0", "1", ...

<P>Action or side-effects: A second call to this function over-rides any
previous settings. In other words, multiple calls are not additive.&nbsp;
Therefore, you must list all the sweeps you want in a single call.

<P>RSL_read_these_sweeps("1", "2", NULL);

<P>which&nbsp; reads the second and third sweep is not the same as:

<P>RSL_read_these_sweeps("1", NULL);
<BR>RSL_read_these_sweeps("2", NULL);

<P>wherein, only the third (index 2) sweep is ingested.

Return value</H3>
Upon successful completion, RSL_read_these_sweeps silently sets a hidden
array that each of the specific radar format ingest routines access.
